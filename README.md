## üë©‚Äçüíª About Me  
I'm a Machine Learning and Data Science enthusiast with hands-on experience in building intelligent systems across deep learning, computer vision, natural language processing, and speech recognition. I primarily work with Python and have experience using frameworks such as **TensorFlow**, **PyTorch**, and **OpenCV**, along with tools like **Docker** and **AWS**.

I'm currently pursuing my **B.Tech in Computer Science and Technology** at **MAIT**, and I'm always open to contributing to impactful AI projects, research collaborations, or open-source work.

## üîç Key Interests  
Recently, I've been exploring:
- **Generative AI** and **Large Language Models (LLMs)**, particularly in retrieval-augmented and context-aware applications  
- **Meta-Reinforcement Learning** and few-shot generalization in adaptive environments  
- Building scalable **machine learning pipelines** and full-stack **AI workflows**
